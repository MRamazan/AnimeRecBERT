# AnimeRecBERT: BERT-Based Anime Recommendation System

**AnimeRecBERT** is a personalized anime recommendation system based on a modified BERT architecture. Inspired by traditional BERT models trained on MovieLens, this project introduces several customizations tailored for anime data:

- 🕒 **No positional encoding**, since the dataset contains no temporal information
- 🧠 **Model architecture adjustments** for improved performance on non-sequential preference data
- 🎌 **Anime-specific user-item dataset**
- 🖥️ **GUI interface** for real-time recommendations
