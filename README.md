# AnimeRecBERT: BERT-Based Anime Recommendation System

**AnimeRecBERT** is a personalized anime recommendation system based on BERT transformer architecture. Inspired from [](https://github.com/jaywonchung/BERT4Rec-VAE-Pytorch), this project introduces customizations tailored for an anime recommendation system:

- 🕒 **No positional encoding**, since the dataset contains no temporal information
- 🧠 **Model architecture adjustments** for improved performance on non-sequential preference data
- 🎌 **Anime-specific user-item dataset**
- 🖥️ **GUI interface** for real-time recommendations
